Hi, Iâ€™m @SachaLheveder. I'm a 4th year honours pure math student at McGill University in Montreal.
My research interests lie primarily in group theory. More recently I became interested in data analytics and statistics.

- I'm currently learning Python and Matlab. I have used Java and R in the past as well.
- Iâ€™m very interested in analytics as it pertains to sports and financial markets. I'm also interested in machine learning and have attended seminars on the fundamentals of neural networks, which I found very interesting
