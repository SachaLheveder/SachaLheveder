Hi, I’m @SachaLheveder. I'm a 1st year Masters student in pure math at McGill University in Montreal.
My research interests lie primarily in operator algebras and group theory. I am also interested in parts of descriptive set theory and the study of borel equivalence relations.

- I have used Java, Python, Matlab, and R
